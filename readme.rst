This code is a fork from the code at  https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/camera.html such that it works on Windows.

Steps to run:

#. Follow the installation part of the tutorial.
#. Make sure you have a virtual environment with the packages from `requirements.txt` installed.
#. If it doesn't exist yet, create an environment variable `PYTHONPATH` with value `C:/path/to/tensorflow/models/research;C:/path/to/tensorflow/models/research/object_detection`
#. Reboot.
